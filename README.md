# 🚗 Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Route Optimization

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project is a **real-time traffic analysis and route optimization system** that helps users find the **fastest and most efficient routes** between locations using **live traffic data**. It integrates real-time traffic information, calculates optimal routes, and displays them on an **interactive map** using **Folium**. The project also provides **traffic trend analysis** to help users understand congestion patterns over time.

The project features a **Streamlit-based web interface** to make all functionalities easily accessible and user-friendly.

## ✨ Features  
- 📍 **Real-time traffic data retrieval** from Google Maps API.
- 🗺️ **Interactive route visualization** on dynamic maps using **Folium**.
- 📊 **Traffic trend analysis** using visual charts (Plotly).
- 🧩 **Route optimization** based on current traffic conditions.
- 💻 **Streamlit interface** for seamless user experience.
