#Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Route Optimization

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on real-time traffic analysis and route optimization, providing users with live traffic data, optimal routes, and travel time predictions between selected locations. By integrating Google Maps API, the system captures real-time traffic conditions to suggest the fastest route and displays it using interactive maps.

In addition to live route guidance, the application also analyzes traffic trends over time, offering insights into congestion patterns for better planning. The Streamlit interface ensures easy access to all features, combining data visualization and real-time map rendering for an intuitive user experience.

🔧 Features
	•	Real-time traffic data retrieval from Google Maps API.
	•	Optimal route recommendation based on live traffic conditions.
	•	Interactive map visualization with route overlays using Folium.
	•	Historical traffic trend analysis with dynamic charts (Plotly).
	•	Simple and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python - Core programming language.
	•	Streamlit - Interactive web interface.
	•	Google Maps API - Real-time traffic data and routing.
	•	Folium - Map visualization and route plotting.
	•	Plotly - Traffic trend visualization.
	•	Polyline - Route geometry handling.
	•	Pandas - Data processing and manipulation.

📂 Project Components
	•	Traffic Data Handling - Fetching live traffic data and calculating optimal routes.
	•	Map Display - Visualizing traffic routes and congestion on interactive Folium maps.
	•	Trend Analysis - Using Plotly charts to display traffic patterns over time.
	•	User Interface - Built using Streamlit, combining maps, charts, and real-time data into a single dashboard.

🌐 Use Case

This application can be extended for:
	•	Logistics companies to optimize delivery routes.
